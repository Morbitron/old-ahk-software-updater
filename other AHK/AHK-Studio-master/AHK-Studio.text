1.005.06:
Fixed:
- Indent with the syntax "Function(){ ;Comment" was causing issues
- History: Having duplicate entries for files
Changed:
- Menu Icons: If you have an icon for every Menu Item it takes about 2.5 seconds to load them all.  I changed it so that they load afterward.
Fixed: Reported by Joe Glines
